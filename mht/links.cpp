 | Each LINK_NODE contains a pointer to the object that it links with
 | and a pointer to its partner.  When a LINK_NODE is deleted, it
 | must delete it's partner.  To avoid infinite recursion (the partner
 | trying to delete the node back), the pointer to the object is used
 | as a flag.  If the pointer is null when the destructor is called,
 | it means that the LINK_NODE is being deleted by its partner, and
 | shouldn't try to delete its partner back.
