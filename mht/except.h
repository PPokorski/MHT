 *   29 JAN 93 -- (mlm) created                                      *
 *    9 MAR 93 -- (mlm) changed to use SAFE_GLOBAL() macro instead   *
 *                of GLOBAL_PTR() macro                              *
 *   28 MAY 93 -- (mlm) removed all attempts to make compatible with *
 *                standard C++ exception handling,                   *
 *                removed TRY and CATCH_ERR,                         *
 *                added #define structure for TSTBUG and DEBUG,      *
 *                changed BEGIN_SCOPE to BGN,                        *
 *                completely rewrote comments                        *
 *   20 FEB 95 -- (mlm) changed naming of secret identifiers from    *
 *                "_name" to "Xname" for portability                 *
 *   21 FEB 95 -- (mlm) added CANT_RECUR macro, changed              *
 *                implementation of m_actionStream in SCOPE_TRACER   *
 *                so that it isn't constructed until it's needed     *
 *                (its construction was causing infinite             *
 *                recursion in new())                                *

 *   Macros and routines useful for tracking down errors.            *
 *                                                                   *

 *   When this macro appears at the beginning of a routine, and      *
 *   TSTBUG is defined, it checks to make sure that the routine is   *
 *   not being called recursively.  If the routine IS called         *
 *   recursively, CANT_RECUR will spit a "FATAL BUG" message onto    *
 *   stderr and _exit the program.                                   *
 *                                                                   *
 *                     TSTBUG and DEBUG                              *
 *                                                                   *
 *   There are two manifest defines used to control the amount of    *
 *   self-checking that other modules do.  If neither of them is     *
 *   #defined, hardly any checking should be done at all.            *
 *                                                                   *
 *   TSTBUG --                                                       *
 *     When this is defined, checks are performed which don't reduce *
 *     speed to the point of making the program unusable.  In        *
 *     general, it should be defined whenever new code is being      *
 *     tested.                                                       *
 *                                                                   *
 *   DEBUG --                                                        *
 *     When this is defined, maximal checking is performed.  Every   *
 *     piece of memory that is allocated is checked for corruption,  *
 *     every data structure that is modified is checked for internal *
 *     consistancy, etc.  The program will grind to a near stand-    *
 *     still, but catastrophic bugs will be much easier to find.     *
 *                                                                   *
 *     When DEBUG is defined, TSTBUG is automatically defined as     *
 *     well.                                                         *
 *                                                                   *
 *                          THROW_ERR()                              *
 *                                                                   *
 *   This spits an error message out to stderr, and exits.           *
 *   If BGN has been used (see below), and TSTBUG is defined, then   *
 *   a trace of scopes in which the error ocurred will be spat out   *
 *   as well.                                                        *
 *                                                                   *
 *   THROW_ERR() takes one argument, which is used to construct a    *
 *   text description of the error.  The argument is placed after a  *
 *   stream object and <<.  This means that it can contain a         *
 *   sequence of printable objects, separated by <<'s.  For example: *
 *                                                                   *
 *     THROW_ERR( "Cannot open file '" << fileName << "'" )          *
 *                                                                   *
 *   If fileName is a pointer to the string "bummer.txt", then the   *
 *   string this generates is                                        *
 *                                                                   *
 *     Cannot open file 'bummer.txt'                                 *
 *                                                                   *
 *                   BGN, TRACE, and ACTION()                        *
 *                                                                   *
 *   These three macros provide mechanisms for tracing the activity  *
 *   of the program.  The traced activity is printed out by          *
 *   THROW_ERR() when an error occurs, giving detailed information   *
 *   about where it occured.                                         *
 *                                                                   *
 *   When TSTBUG is not defined, these macros do nothing (and add no *
 *   code).                                                          *
 *                                                                   *
 *   BGN --                                                          *
 *     This should be placed at the beginning of each routine.  It   *
 *     makes a record of the name of the file and the line number    *
 *     that it appears on.  This record is stored on the stack, and  *
 *     contains a pointer to the previous such record on the stack,  *
 *     forming a linked list of active routines.                     *
 *                                                                   *
 *     The record formed by BGN also contains space for a string     *
 *     that can be filled in by the ACTION() macro (see below).      *
 *                                                                   *
 *     When BGN goes out of scope (i.e. the routine returns), the    *
 *     record it created is removed from the stack, and from the     *
 *     linked list.                                                  *
 *                                                                   *
 *   TRACE --                                                        *
 *     This may only be used in routines that contain BGN.  It       *
 *     changes the line number in BGN's record to the line number on *
 *     which it appears.  This is useful for finding the exact line  *
 *     on which an error occured.                                    *
 *                                                                   *
 *   ACTION() --                                                     *
 *     This is just like TRACE, except that it constructs a string   *
 *     in BGN's record, which is added to the output of THROW_ERR(). *
 *                                                                   *
 *     The string is constructed in the same way as the error string *
 *     in THROW_ERR(), so, for example                               *
 *                                                                   *
 *       ACTION( "Opening file '" << fileName << "'" )               *
 *                                                                   *
 *     constructs the string                                         *
 *                                                                   *
 *       Opening file 'bummer.txt'                                   *
 *                                                                   *
 *     (assuming that fileName still points to "bummer.txt").        *
 *                                                                   *
 *   Here's an example of how BGN, TRACE, ACTION(), and THROW_ERR()  *
 *   are used:                                                       *
 *                                                                   *
 *   Suppose we have two files, main.C and foo.C.                    *
 *   main.C contains:                                                *
 *                                                                   *

 *   This is just a simple routine that prints a number of spaces to *
 *   cout.  It takes one argument: the number of spaces to print.    *
 *                                                                   *
 *   I find this useful in printing diagnostics.                     *
 *                                                                   *

 *   This routine causes the program to crash and dump core.  It's   *
 *   useful when the program has detected a particularly             *
 *   catastrophic problem.                                           *
 *                                                                   *

 *   In much of except.H and except.C, I use fprintf() where it      *
 *   would be more C++'ish to use cerr (from iostream.h).  I do this *
 *   because the iostream stuff likes to allocate memory when you    *
 *   use it, and that can cause serious problems if the error you're *
 *   reporting has to do with problems allocating memory.  The       *
 *   stdio stuff is more robust.                                     *
 *                                                                   *
