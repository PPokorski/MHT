 *                                                                   *
 *              Representation of Assignment Problems                *
 *                                                                   *
 *   An assignment problem is represented as an array of possible    *
 *   assignments.  Each possible assignment is stored in a           *
 *   ROW_COL_COST structure.  This name is historical.  Originally,  *
 *   I was representing assignment problems in the traditional way   *
 *   of using an assignment matrix -- hence the references to        *
 *   "rows" and "columns".  But matrices proved too limited, and     *
 *   made for messy code, so I switched to bipartite graphs.  Now,   *
 *   "row" refers to nodes on one side of the graph, "col" refers    *
 *   to nodes on the other, and a ROW_COL_COST structure stores      *
 *   the cost of assigning one "row" to one "col" (the cost of an    *
 *   arc between the row and the column).                            *
 *                                                                   *
 *   Rows and columns are identified with positive integers.  If a   *
 *   row may be left unassigned, then the problem representation     *
 *   should include a ROW_COL_COST with that row number, a column    *
 *   number of -1, and the cost of leaving the row unassigned.       *
 *   Similarly, if a column may be left unassigned, then there       *
 *   should be a ROW_COL_COST with that column number, a row number  *
 *   of -1, and the cost of leaving the column unassigned.           *
 *                                                                   *
 *   There may be more than one ROW_COL_COST for the same pair of    *
 *   rows and columns, giving different costs of assigning them in   *
 *   different ways.  Of course, if FindBestAssignment() (see below) *
 *   is used to find the best solution to the problem, then it will  *
 *   ignore all but the lowest-cost possible assignment between each *
 *   row-column pair.  However, the higher-cost assignments can      *
 *   become important when using ASSIGNMENT_PQUEUE objects to find   *
 *   the second-best solution, third-best, and so on.                *
 *                                                                   *
 *   Some row and column numbers might not appear in any             *
 *   ROW_COL_COST's.  These will be ignored.                         *
 *                                                                   *
 *   Each ROW_COL_COST structure contains an additional field that   *
 *   is used to identify it.  A solution to an assignment problem    *
 *   (see below) is given as a VECTOR of these "tag" fields,         *
 *   identifying a set of assignments used.  The tag field is        *
 *   declared as a void pointer.  By default, it points to the       *
 *   ROW_COL_COST structure itself, but it may be set to point to    *
 *   any object with which that particular assignment is associated. *
 *   If it is set to 0, it will never appear in the solution VECTOR, *
 *   even if the assignment is used.                                 *
 *                                                                   *
 *   The ROW_COL_COST structures must be sorted first by row, then   *
 *   by column, then by cost.  The routine SortAssignmentProblem()   *
 *   is provided for this purpose (see below).                       *
 *                                                                   *
 *   In addition to the array of ROW_COL_COST structures, and the    *
 *   number of structures in the array, most routines that take      *
 *   assignment problems as input also want to be given the number   *
 *   of rows and the number of columns.  These are used to optimize  *
 *   memory usage, and need not be exact.  As long as the given      *
 *   number of rows is greater than the largest row number appearing *
 *   in any ROW_COL_COST, and the number of columns is greater than  *
 *   the largest column number, then the routine will work.          *
 *                                                                   *
 *   To summarize, an assingment problem is given to a routine by    *
 *   means of four variables:                                        *
 *                                                                   *
 *     ROW_COL_COST *rcc -- A sorted array of possible assignments.  *
 *     int numRCCs -- The number of entries in rcc.                  *
 *     int numRows -- Greater than the largest row number in rcc.    *
 *     int numCols -- Greater than the largest column number in rcc. *
 *                                                                   *
 *                     SortAssignmentProblem()                       *
 *                                                                   *
 *   This takes a list of ROW_COL_COST's and calls qsort() to sort   *
 *   it properly.                                                    *
 *                                                                   *
 *                     FindBestAssignment()                          *
 *                                                                   *
 *   This takes an assignment problem, represented in the way        *
 *   described above, and finds the set of assignments that has the  *
 *   lowest total cost and assigns each row to one column, and each  *
 *   column to one row (some rows and columns might be left          *
 *   unassigned, if there are ROW_COL_COST's that assign them        *
 *   to -1).  The solution is returned in a VECTOR_OF< void * > as   *
 *   a list of ROW_COL_COST tags.                                    *
 *                                                                   *
 *   The return value of FindBestAssignment() gives the total cost   *
 *   of the assignment found.  If there are no solutions, then       *
 *   FindBestAssignment() returns UNSOLVABLE.                        *
 *                                                                   *
