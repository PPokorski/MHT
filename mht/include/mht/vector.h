 *   Template for resizeable, one dimensional array.                 *

 *   The template is used in one of the following ways:              *
 *                                                                   *
 *     VECTOR_OF< type > vec;                                        *
 *     VECTOR_OF< type > vec( highIndex );                           *
 *     VECTOR_OF< type > vec( lowIndex, highIndex );                 *
 *                                                                   *
 *   Where                                                           *
 *                                                                   *
 *     type = the type of object to be contained in the vector       *
 *     vec = the vector object                                       *
 *     highIndex = highest allowable index into vec                  *
 *     lowIndex = lowest allowable index into vec                    *
 *                                                                   *
 *   When lowIndex is not given, it defaults to 0.  So vec( 5 )      *
 *   constructs a 6 element vector, indexed from vec[ 0 ] to         *
 *   vec[ 5 ].                                                       *
 *                                                                   *
 *   When neither lowIndex nor highIndex is given, no memory is      *
 *   allocated, and the vector cannot be used until it is resized    *
 *   (see below).                                                    *
 *                                                                   *
 *   The vector has the following member functions:                  *
 *                                                                   *
 *     operator[]( index ) --                                        *
 *       Access a given element of the vector.                       *
 *                                                                   *
 *     resize( highIndex ), or                                       *
 *     resize( lowIndex, highIndex ) --                              *
 *       Change the limits on the index.  New memory is only         *
 *       allocated if the old buffer isn't big enough.  Resize       *
 *       never causes the vector to free any memory.  That can only  *
 *       be done by destroying the vector and constructing a new     *
 *       one.                                                        *
 *                                                                   *
 *     clear() --                                                    *
 *       Set all the bytes in the vector to 0.  This is dangerous,   *
 *       and is meant only for use with vectors of simple data       *
 *       types.                                                      *
